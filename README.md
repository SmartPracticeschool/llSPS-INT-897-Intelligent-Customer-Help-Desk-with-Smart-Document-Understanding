# Project Title : Intelligent Customer Help Desk with Smart Document Understanding

# Project Description : The typical customer care chatbot can answer simple questions, such as store locations, hours, and directions, and maybe even make appointments. When a question falls outside of the scope of the pre-determined question set, the option is typically to tell the customer that the question isn’t valid or offer to speak to a real person.
In this, we provide another option. If the customer question is about the operation of a device, we use the search skill feature of Watson Assistant to pass the question on to the Watson Discovery service, which has been pre-loaded with the device’s owners manual. So now, instead of “Would you like to speak to a customer representative?,” we can return relevant sections of the owners manual to help solve the customers’ problems.
To take it a step further, we use the Smart Document Understanding feature of Watson Discovery to train it on what text in the owners manual is important and what is not. This improves the answers returned from the queries.
